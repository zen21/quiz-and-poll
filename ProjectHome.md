With Quiz & Poll, teachers & educators can create quizzes and polls easily using Google Spreadsheets. Quizzes and Polls are distributed to students via Android app or an embeddable webplayer. The spreadsheet also contains statistics of student's responses and a leaderboard, which can be used for evaluation.

**Key Features:**
  * Quizzes and polls are easily created and administered on Google Spreadsheets.
  * Students can download the Android App to take the quiz or live classroom poll.
  * For students without Android phones, quizzes and polls can be accessed via a web interface (works on laptops, iPhones, iPads etc.).
  * Administrators can view quiz and poll statistics on the same Spreadsheet.

**Deployment instructions:**
  * HowToDeploy

**Sample implementation:**

A sample implementation site and app has been released by <a href='https://plus.google.com/100156589101321820776/about'>David VÃ¡vra</a>, former intern at Google for the Learning Technology Team.

**So what should you choose?**
  * If you are a teacher and just want to use Quiz & Poll in your class, use the sample implementation. All [documentation](http://quiz-n-poll.appspot.com) is there for you and students can download the [Android app](https://market.android.com/details?id=org.quizpoll).
  * If you are thinking about creating a siloed version just for your school/organization or modifying the functionality for a different purpose, you can [deploy it](HowToDeploy.md) on your own server and manage it yourself. It's a good idea to discuss it on [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/quiz-and-poll) first so that your contribution can be added to the main code repository.
